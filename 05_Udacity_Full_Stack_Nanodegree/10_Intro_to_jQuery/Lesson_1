 Lesson 1 Notes

jQuery is a JavaScript library

$ and jQuery are mapped to the same thing! haha

$ is just easier to type than jQuery!

$ -> jQuery collection (like an array but with additional methods)

$(string) -> can pass a string
$(funciton) -> can pass in a functin
$(DOM Element)
$.ajax()

The DOM

body(children below)
	div
		ul (unordered list)
			li
		form
			input

ul and form are siblings

Can add jQuery to any website using script tags like the following:

	local (for jQuery hosted on your own server):
		<script src='js/jquery.min.js'></script>

	jQuery official (good to use, too...but CDN is optimal)
		<script src='//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.1.min.js'></script>
	Content Delivery Network (CDNs, like Google) (*recommended*)
		<script src='//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js'></script>

Use jQuery minified version (min) because it's sig smaller and thus performance is better

Some jQuery selectors

	$('tag') -> not very useful
	$('.class') e.g. $('.green') selects all elements of class green
	$('#id') -> specific to single elements

DOM traversal methods

	to find parent (go up only a single level in a tree): $('#idchild').parent()
	
	.parents(): finds all parents above you (go up many levels in a tree)
	
	to find a specific parent: $('#idchild').parents('#idparent')

	to find immediate children:
	$('#idparent').children()

	to find grandchildren (or children more than 1 down the DOM tree):
	$('#idparent').find() -->(you need to pass in a descriptor, and so to find all children, you would type .find(*))

	to find siblings (elements with same parent):
	$('#idsibling').siblings()

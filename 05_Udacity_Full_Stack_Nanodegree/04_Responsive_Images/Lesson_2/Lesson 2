Lesson 2 Takeaways

1) Add a width width between images by adding a style tag to the HEAD element.

	Example:

	<style>
	    body {
	      margin: 0;
	    }
	    img {
	      float: left;
	      margin-right: 10px;
	      width: calc((100% - 20px)/3)
	    }
	    img:last-of-type {
	        margin-right: 0;
	    }
  	</style>

 2) You can use vw, vh, vmin, and vmax if you want an image to fit the size of a viewport.

 	Example:

 	<body>
 		<img src= "../../images/two_kittens_large.jpg" alt="Lias and little puss" style="
 			height: 100vh;
 		">
 		</body>

 3) Raster and Vector. Vector > Raster

 	To ways to create images. Raster images may come from camera or scanner or from the html canvas elements. They are a grid of colored dots

 	Vectors are like logos and can be created from adobe illustrator and other programs, or from using a vector format such as svg.

 	Vectors describe the geometry not individual dots of color.

 	Browsers can render a vector image at any size. SVG is perfect at any size. Raster formats can get blurry.

 	Vector image scales without quality degradation. Vector images can be scaled infinitely!

 	Vector images are also smaller!

 4) For photographic images, use jpeg or WebP where supported.

 5) For logos, use SVG for vector images. If you can't, use png. Always use png over gif (better compression and no licensing issues).

 6) There's no need to send images with natural resolutions higher than their display resolutions (unless you need to scale up for high DPI devices)

 7) Use image optimization tools such as ImageMagick.

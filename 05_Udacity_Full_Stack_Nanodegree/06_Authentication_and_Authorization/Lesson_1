Lesson 1 Notes

Add security features to web applications, allowing users to log in securely and access permission systems, using OAuth2 providers

1) Difference between authentication and authorization

Authentication = Process of verifying you are who you say you are (e.g. passwords to log in).

	Securing your web application:

		Strong passwords
		Strong encryption
		Secure communication
		Password storage
		Password recovery
		2-factor authentification that requires 2 keys
		Man-in-middle attack

	Can use third-party authentication such as with facebook and google+

		Pros:
		+ outsource auth handling to OAuth providers
		+ easier to register users (less friction)
		+ less passwords for users to remember

		Cons:
		- users don't trust your site
			-> keep auth scopes minimum
		- limited / restricted internet access
		- different auth requirements (need a stronger p/w than offered by third-party)

Authorization = Do you have the right to the resource you are trying to access ("are you on the VIP list?"). When you first log in via facebook / google+, the third party asks whether they have permission to do something. Authorization allows users to log in to an application while still protecting its most valuable assets.

	Most of times, authorization happens with authentication, but can happen too without authentication too (e.g. coupons and discounts without having to authenticate, cookies, public files that require a link in dropbox)

	OAuth = most widely used standard for authorization.

		- open standard
		- openID connect = application built on OAuth

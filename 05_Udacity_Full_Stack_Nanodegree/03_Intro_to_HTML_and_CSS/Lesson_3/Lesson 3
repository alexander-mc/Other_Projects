Lesson 3 Takeaways

#1) Media queries

	+ "media" means this is a media query
	+ "only" means this works on old browsers
	+ "screen" means this works on all screens
		++ An alternative would be "print," which only works if printed
	+"p" makes changes to all paragraphs

	Example:

		@media only screen and (max-width: 500px) {
		    p {
		        display: none;
		    }
		}


#2) Add this link to make sure all css files work across all browsers

	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
		<head>
			<link rel="stylesheet" src="//normalize-css.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/normalize.css">
		</head>
		<body>
		</body>
	<html>


#3) Put placeholder images into your file.

	placekitten.com
	placehold.it


#4) Find a font via google.com/fonts, then place the link in <head>. Then go into your CSS file to make sure font is being used.

	Example:

	<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans" rel="stylesheet">

	THEN, in CSS file:

	* {
	font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
	}


#5) The * symbol in CSS means everything.

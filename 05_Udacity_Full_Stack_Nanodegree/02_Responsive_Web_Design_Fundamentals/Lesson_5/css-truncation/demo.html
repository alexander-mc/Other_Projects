        <h2>Large block of text with truncation</h2>
        <p class="block-with-text">Two years ago we launched Hacking UI as a blog to share our thoughts about improving the workflow between designers and developers. I think it’s fair to say that today, Hacking UI has evolved to become much more than a blog.
            Hacking UI has become a community, and for that we have you to thank. Thank you for your consistent support in everything we’ve done throughout the years.
            Because of your support, today we are announcing that we are both quitting our day jobs and going to work on Hacking UI full time!

            I don’t think we ever imagined that we would reach this point, and have the ability to do what we love day in and day out. We’re absolutely thrilled and cannot wait to get started.
            Now that we have this opportunity, we want to help you get there too. We’ve talked to many of you, and we realized quickly that we’re not the only ones who have a dream to turn their side project into a business and to build something that can provide the financial support to allow you to work on what you love.

            So we’re launching The Side Project Accelerator, an 8-week mentorship program to help you launch your side project and build a successful business out of it.</p>

        <h2>Small text, less then one row. (no truncation)</h2>

        <h2>2.5 lines example (still works and doesn't truncate)</h2>

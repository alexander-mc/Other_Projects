Lesson 2 Takeaways

#1: Define the viewport. Put on top of html to make responsive:

	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

#2: Max-width on elements. Adjust headers / footers / etc. by 100% (a relative value), not 
    a fixed amount.

#3: Tap target sizes. Make sure all buttons (known as “a tags,” typically 
    designated by “a”) include a min-width and min-height of 48px

	-> This also can be a padding of 1.5em (or 1.5 times the font size), as per the 
	solution in the lesson exercise)

Lesson 1 Notes

ls = list; gives a list of files in the folder

curl = command to download files from the internet

Terminal vs shell

	terminal = terminal emulator = displays outputs from screen and accepts input from keyboard

	shell = interprets what you wrote as a command, and then runs output to command

		lots of different shell programs, but default on max is gnubash (or bash)

history = history of commands

date = tells time

expr = calculator (expr = expresssion = evaluate)

echo = shell's name for print statement

uname = operating system (uname -a gives more information)

hostname = prints out computer name

host = looks up name in ip address

bash --version = tells you what version of bash shell you have

---

shell command vs python functions

both units are units of code, both have a name, and can take arguments
but most commands are whole programs. shell commands are used to run programs but python functions are used to organize code

ctrl+r = reverse i search = lets you search your shell history

unzip + filename = unzips a file

cat = prints out content of file (cat = concatenate)

[tab] = autocompletion

wc = word count program = tells how many lines, words, and bytes are in a file

diff = compares files and tells you how they differ

man = manual

. = files that start with a . are usually used for caching information and other things we don't usually use

ls -a (also, ls --all) = all, don't ignore . files

ls -l = long-listing

apropos =

	You can use apropos to find commands relevant to particular keywords.

	For example apropos working directory provides a list of commands that somehow work with the current working directory.

	apropos is good for refreshing your memory, or for finding new commands to explore!

ctrl+c = how to stop some programs

ctrl+d = how to execute and then stop other programs, such as 'sort'

less = a program to read text one line at a time (the 'man' command uses this)

nano = editing files, built into ubunto

writeout = save the file

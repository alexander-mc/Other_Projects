Lesson 3 Notes

directors = like folders

When you write a filename with a space or special punctuation, put the text in 'quotes' or procede each special char with \

	e.g. Great Filename! = 'Great Filename!' or Great\ Filename\!

\ = escaping

pwd = print working directory

cd = change directory

cd .. = go up the tree to the parent directory

/ = root direcotry

absolute path = full path from the root path

relative path (e.g. bash) = referring to a file using just the name

mv = move a file; you can also use it to rename a file in the same direcotry, or to move several files into a directory

cp = copying files; you can copy using a different name in the same directory, or a filename in a different directory, or a directory you want to put the new copy in

mkdir = making directories

rmdir = remove directory (can't remove directories with files)

remdir -r = removes all files in directory

Globbing = operating on files by name

	ls *app matches all files with app at end
	ls *app* matches files with app in between
	ls b*png matches files that start with b and end with png
	ls {css,html} matches files that end in css or html (NO SPACE!!!)
	ls bea?.png = matches any one character, such as bean or bear (but not beast.png), while ?? matches any two characters, etc.
	ls be[aeiou]r.png matches any character within the brackets
	ls *{jpg, JPG} matches all files that end in jpg or JPG

	Samples from Udacity quiz:

	cp www/*html backup --> copy all files in the 'www' directory that end in 'html' to the 'backup' directory

	ls *{jpg,png} --> list all files ending in 'jpg' or 'png' in the current directory

	echo Short names: ? --> print 'short names:' followed by all one-character filenames in the current directory.

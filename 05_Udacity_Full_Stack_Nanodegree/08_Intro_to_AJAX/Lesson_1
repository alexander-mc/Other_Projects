Lesson 1 Notes

1) AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML) request. Allows data to be retrieved asynchronously.
	Data that loads asynchronously can be requested late in the load process and the website should load acceptably with or without it.

2) API sites

	https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/

	https://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory

3) jQuery = A JavaScript library meant to make a number of common JS tasks simpler, via consistent API across all browsers.

	Can use jQuery's AJAX methods which helps ensure that AJAX requests work in every browser.

	Common for developers to use libraries to write AJAX calls

	jQuery looks like the following:

		function loadData() {

	    var $body = $('body');
	    var $wikiElem = $('#wikipedia-links');       <- the second dollar sign is a 
	    											 pointer to a jquery object. The # 
	    											 sign represents an id.
	    var $nytHeaderElem = $('#nytimes-header');
	    var $nytElem = $('#nytimes-articles');
	    var $greeting = $('#greeting');

4) In the project, you'll be using two of jQuery's AJAX methods, jQuery.ajax() and jQuery.getJSON()
